description: A bit about some things I like

Consider this a running list of random interests that I have. This will be periodically updated whenever I feel like it.


## video games

### [Hades](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1145360/Hades/)
When I first got this game, I played it for 8 hours a day for several days.
0 regret. Amazing art, music, story, gameplay. 100/10.

### [Hollow Knight](https://store.steampowered.com/app/367520/Hollow_Knight/)
This game is so beautiful. The environments are well distinguished not only by color pallet but the flora and fauna. 
The creature designs are simplistic but very aesthetically pleasing (speaking as someone who – before playing this game – was not a fan of bug characters at all).
Christopher Larkin is also an amazing composer. My favorite track is Greenpath mainly because of its tranquility (it makes good study music).
My only complaint is that it's too difficult for me :/

### [Townscaper](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1291340/Townscaper/)
Super calming and beautiful. It's very satisfying to make towns and take pictures in the golden hour light.


## art

### The Art Institute of Chicago
I went to this museum a few months ago and it's huge and amazing! 
They have some really cool African, Native American, and Asian exhibits (*although I'm a bit conflicted about their presence in the museum, which implies their absence in the hands of their creator's family*). 
They had a lot of famous impressionist artworks as well, which were stunning in person.
I loved being able to see Van Gogh's self portrait in person. The colors have such vibrancy and life that I've never seen portrayed in pictures.

### [Coolors](https://coolors.co/generate)
This website is super helpful for me as someone who enjoys designing and making art but is terrible at coming up with nice color palettes.
They even recently added lots of cool functionalities to the generator (ex. generator methods).
